- Hi, I’m Hrithik Ravi (pronounced "rih-thick")!
- UMich '23 - studying CS with a Math minor.
- Interested in broadening my technological expertise and not simply staying within my comfort zone. I'm especially keen on exploring intelligent systems, XR, and cybersecurity. 
- These are the technologies I'm currently learning through school as well as on my own: fullstack development, computer vision, and conversational AI. 

**Searching for summer 2022 tech/software internships.**

If you have a cool idea and want a skilled programmer with a strong mathematical background, shoot me an email at hrithikr@umich.edu and I'll respond ASAP.
