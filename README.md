- Hi, I’m Hrithik Ravi! Currently a junior at the University of Michigan studying CS with a Math minor.
- I'm interested in broadening my technological expertise and not simply staying within my comfort zone. 
- I'm especially keen on exploring intelligent systems, XR, blockchain, and cybersecurity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning these technologies through school as well as on my own: fullstack development, computer vision, and conversational AI. 

If you have a cool idea and need skilled algo developers, shoot an email to hrithikr@umich.edu and I'll respond ASAP.
